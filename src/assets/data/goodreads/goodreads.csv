Without electric power generation and distribution; we'd have been unable to operate businesses 24/7, have limited light in the nighttime, and we'd have a hell of a hard time heating our homes in wintertime. This book is a bit hard to digest in some places, but it explores the politics of metering, difficult problem of maintaining-revitalizing our electrical network, and accounts key historic milestones. It's clear that innovation for power distribution needs to continue such that we have totally reliable and accessible access to energy.",,,0,read,1,

Seeing the world as black and white as opposed to a moral gray area is highly emphasized here. What if superheroes weren't the undisputed good? What if they had individual agendas separated from moral values? From the Comedian to Rorschach to Dr. Manhattan, this book is made by its tainted characters. The ending here is thought invoking - something missing from superhero literature targeted to pre-adolescent boys. What if we could do something horrific for a good intended outcome? Does the ends justify the means? I'm really glad Alan Moore created this historic piece of art, which was released before the iconic Batman Killing Joke novel. It really shows that comic books have potential to match the deep introspective reflection of classic novels (1984).",,,0,read,1,

I find it genius how she uses notes to remind herself her job during her sessions : ""You are a notetaker. Stop talking"".

This book was like listening to a story, it was learning from an incredible series of experiences by the engineer, business executive, innovator, etc. behind the modern day smartphone, smart home technology. I was not familiar with Tony Fadell prior to reading this book, but they advice he gives here makes it clear that he is an incredibly driven, yet grounded person. Tony's lessons here are very much to gravitate towards good, purpose-driven teams and make things better through the products you make. His description of what we call ""common sense"" is very perceptive : it's common, but not shared. I want to read this book again soon when I'm in need of a mentor. It is 100% a mentor in a box, as Tony described it at the start of the book.",,,0,read,1,

Whenever we make a decision, it is based on whatever knowledge we have available. Decisions are effectively bets. This is a great take on the idea that all we really have control over is the decisions we make with finite information. I think I'll appreciate this more in the future, but overall a solid read.
