0,26073005,The Grid: The Fraying Wires Between Americans and Our Energy Future,Gretchen Bakke,2024/06/22,384,4,"This book emphasizes the importance of 20th century innovation and systems in building modern society. Without electric power generation and distribution; we'd have been unable to operate businesses 24/7, have limited light in the nighttime, and we'd have a hell of a hard time heating our homes in wintertime. This book is a bit hard to digest in some places, but it explores the politics of metering, difficult problem of maintaining-revitalizing our electrical network, and accounts key historic milestones. It's clear that innovation for power distribution needs to continue such that we have totally reliable and accessible access to energy."
1,40603783,The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matterâ€”And How to Make the Most of Them Now,Meg Jay,2023/04/01,273,5,The underlying theme of this book is that we have less time than we think we do. It encourages proactive planning and decision making towards meaningful things.
2,59783101,Build: An Unorthodox Guide to Making Things Worth Making,Tony Fadell,2022/11/12,414,5,"I'm not much of a reader - I read incredibly slow and it takes forever for me to advance through ~400 pages. This book was like listening to a story, it was learning from an incredible series of experiences by the engineer, business executive, innovator, etc. behind the modern day smartphone, smart home technology. I was not familiar with Tony Fadell prior to reading this book, but they advice he gives here makes it clear that he is an incredibly driven, yet grounded person. Tony's lessons here are very much to gravitate towards good, purpose-driven teams and make things better through the products you make. His description of what we call ""common sense"" is very perceptive : it's common, but not shared. I want to read this book again soon when I'm in need of a mentor. It is 100% a mentor in a box, as Tony described it at the start of the book."
3,36146637,Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts,Annie Duke,2022/08/01,288,4,"This book helped solidify learnings from both personal and professional experience : nothing is ever certain. Whenever we make a decision, it is based on whatever knowledge we have available. Decisions are effectively bets. This is a great take on the idea that all we really have control over is the decisions we make with finite information. I think I'll appreciate this more in the future, but overall a solid read. If anything, my key takeaway is that ""Life is a game of poker, not chess""."
4,53138083,"Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon",Colin Bryar | Bill Carr,2022/07/01,304,5,Really insightful look within Amazon's business operations. I think there was a lot to learn here in terms of both their history as a tech giant as well as how we can apply these methods to our own processes.
5,18492257,Lean Customer Development: Building Products Your Customers Will Buy,Cindy Alvarez,2022/05/01,236,4,"This book contains a really solid guideline for customer interviews. There are nuances in here which really demonstrate Cindy's unique brand as a Product Manager. I find it genius how she uses notes to remind herself her job during her sessions : ""You are a notetaker. Stop talking"". This has lead me to considering adopting UX Research habits aligning with the idea that we are there to observe and to learn; so let's keep quiet and listen as much as we can."
6,472331,Watchmen,Alan             Moore | Dave Gibbons | John    Higgins,2018/04/01,416,5,"This is somehow a superhero graphic novel, a commentary on Western society, a spoof of iconic characters, and a reflection on the 20th century climate. Seeing the world as black and white as opposed to a moral gray area is highly emphasized here. What if superheroes weren't the undisputed good? What if they had individual agendas separated from moral values? From the Comedian to Rorschach to Dr. Manhattan, this book is made by its tainted characters. The ending here is thought invoking - something missing from superhero literature targeted to pre-adolescent boys. What if we could do something horrific for a good intended outcome? Does the ends justify the means? I'm really glad Alan Moore created this historic piece of art, which was released before the iconic Batman Killing Joke novel. It really shows that comic books have potential to match the deep introspective reflection of classic novels (1984)."
